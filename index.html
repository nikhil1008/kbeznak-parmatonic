<p> Relationship of Search Engine Optimization with Google </p> 

<p> In 1998, two graduate students at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/"> Stanford University </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page"> Larry Page </a>  and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin"> Sergey Brin </a>, developed "Backrub", 
 a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. 
  The number calculated by the algorithm, PageRank, is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links. 
  PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web, and follows 
  links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is 
  more likely to be reached by the random web surfer. </P>
