So what is Kbeznak-parmatonic ? Have you ever heard of SEO ( Search Engine Optimization) ?  
Search engine optimization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization"> (SEO) </a> is the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web search engine's unpaid resultsâ€”often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned" results.
SEO encompasses both the technical and creative elements required to improve rankings, drive traffic, and increase awareness in search engines.
This page is created as a part of SEO contest which was one of the assignments in our Information retrieval class. 
The query 'Kbeznak-parmatonic' is not supposed to show any results on state-of-the-art search engine such as Google, 
and our job was to create a webpage that rankls best for this query.

The contest was conducted in the course CSCE 670 taught by - Instructor: <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/">James Caverlee</a> of Department of <a href="http://www.cse.tamu.edu">Computer Science and
Engineering </a> at <a href="http://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&m University</a>

<h2> Relationship of Search Engine Optimization with Google </h2> 

<p> In 1998, two graduate students at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/"> Stanford University </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page"> Larry Page </a>  and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin"> Sergey Brin </a>, developed "Backrub", 
 a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. 
  The number calculated by the algorithm, PageRank, is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links. 
  PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web, and follows 
  links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is 
  more likely to be reached by the random web surfer. </P>

<p> Page and Brin founded <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google </a> in 1998. <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google </a> attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, 
  who liked its simple design. Off-page factors (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> PageRank </a> and hyperlink analysis) were considered as well as 
  on-page factors (such as keyword frequency, meta tags, headings, links and site structure) to enable <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google </a> to avoid the 
  kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. 
  Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> PageRank </a> was more difficult to game, webmasters had already developed link building tools and schemes to 
  influence the Inktomi search engine, and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> PageRank </a>. 
  Many sites focused on exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these schemes, 
  or link farms, involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming.</p>

<p> By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce 
  the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/"> New York Times </a> Saul Hansell stated <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google </a> ranks sites using more 
  than 200 different signals. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they 
  use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, 
  and have shared their personal opinions. Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand 
  search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous 
  searches, Google crafted results for logged in users.</p>

<h2> Information Retrieval </h2> 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval"> Information retrieval (IR) </a> is the activity of obtaining information 
resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.
